The original wildfire dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to its large size.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from the **FireCastRL spatiotemporal wildfire dataset**, which links verified wildfire ignition records with high-resolution meteorological data. The dataset integrates:
- Wildfire ignition records from the Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information (IRWIN) system
- Daily meteorological variables derived from gridMET climate data

The dataset contains tens of thousands of wildfire ignition events with associated spatial, temporal, and environmental variables.

## Data Access
The dataset is publicly available and can be obtained from Kaggle:

- **FireCastRL U.S. Wildfire Dataset**  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/firecastrl/us-wildfire-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/firecastrl/us-wildfire-dataset?resource=download

Users must download the dataset directly from the source and place the relevant files in the appropriate directory before running the data preparation script.
